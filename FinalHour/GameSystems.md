Game Systems

Final Hour will have 3 different game systems in use based on what game modes the player is playing. The Survival system (balanced RPG elements), the DM system (Completely balanced with loadouts and perks), and then the RPG system (Full RPG). The systems are listed below:

Survival System - This system will be used for game modes that include both player versus player battles as well as player versus AI battles. Game modes for this genre include: Survival

		Mechanics:

This game system will allow the player to have only one character and one loadout at any given time. The player is able to design a loadout for their character in the menus before the game has been started. These loadouts are made of small equipment with no real weapons or armor available. Every loadout item is available to every player regardless of play time. There is no level system for this game system (outside of the game). Overall player experience and ingame money is awarded at the end of the game based on performance (how long the player lasted, kills, ect.). Loadouts are able to be customized with miscellaneous things like equipment skins, character voices, ect. These are bought with ingame money and only apply to that character in the game (Ex. buying a voice for your survival character doesn’t mean your RPG character now has that voice).

Once the game has started, the player will be a base character, with attributes of 0,0,0,0. Every 5% of the average amount of time that game is suppose to last (short game average is 30 minutes, so every 90 seconds) the player will gain an attribute point to spend on the four skill branches; agility, strength, knowledge and survival. Once they unlock that new level in the tree, they will be awarded the base stats (Ex. + 3% speed for agility) and the associated perk with that level. Gaining points to spend stops once the average time for that game is hit (also when the player hits 20 attribute points). Skill branches max out at level 10 as well.  Maybe make this where every 6 minutes player gains points based on game time (long game gains 1 point, medium 2, short 3 every 6 minutes.
Weapons crafted and picked up in game will be affected by how your character is built (i.e. picking up a machine gun with level 1 strength will make the machine gun less effective for that player).

DM System - This system will be used for game modes that include only player versus player battles. Game modes for this genre include: Deathmatch, Mutants Versus Humans.

Mechanics:

This game system will allow the player to have only one character but many different loadouts at any given time. Loadouts will consist of weapons, equipment, and perks. All of these items are available for selection to the player no matter how much play time has occurred. There is no leveling system within this system. Overall player experience and ingame money is awarded at the end of the game based on performance (amount of  kills, winning, ect.). Loadouts are also able to be customized with miscellaneous things like weapon skins, character voices, ect. These are bought with ingame money and only apply to that character in the game (Ex. buying a voice for your DM character doesn’t mean your RPG character now has that voice).

Loadouts allow the player up to 5 perks from a pool of many. The player will also be able to choose a primary weapon, a sidearm, and equipment. There are no real skill branches in these game modes as branches like survival and knowledge don’t fit in fast paced gameplay with no crafting or survival skills needed. Perks, weapons, and equipment still allow the player to build their character in their own unique way. Players will have up to 4 custom classes for human loadouts as well as up to 4 custom classes for mutant loadouts.

RPG System - This system will be used for game modes that include only player versus AI battles. Game modes for this genre include: Horde Missions

Mechanics:

		The player will be able to design and develop their character using attributes and
		perks corresponding with the build of the character based on attributes. The 
character will start out with only no points to spend on attributes for the four skill branches. Every 5 levels, the player will earn another skill point to spend on attributes for that character. By level 100, the player will have 20 attribute points spent rather than a level 1 with 10. Perks will need to be bought once they are unlocked before they can be used. Perks are also able to be upgraded up to 5 times to increase their effectiveness and what they can do. Upgrading perks will cost ingame money.

Unlike in other game modes, this character is far more powerful as a level 100 than a level 1. Perks stack, so the higher your level, the more perks you will be able to have. The player will also be able to customize their loadout for weapons, equipment, ect. Unlocking better weapons and equipment can only be done once certain levels are reached and enough ingame money is acquired. Certain weapons and equipment will work better if skill branch terms are met (i.e. a character with more strength will be able to handle a machine gun much better than someone will all agility). Player will have only one custom class for his character but can make up to 4 different characters.
