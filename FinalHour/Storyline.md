The town of Barrowsville. A small city in the southern part of Pennsylvania, USA. The town was born in 1807 and was a normal quiet town. After World War 2, when America thought all the violence was over, the country started focusing on more important aspects in life. One of the aspects was medicine.
	Washington selected Barrowsville as one of their main locations to hold the labs for the medical testing due to the isolation, the space, and the location being close to the capital. So in 1948, Barrowsville morphed from a town to a small city.
	The labs were built as well as main research facilities and storages. Their target; curing terminal illnesses. The town became more well known and started populating more so than ever before. More buildings were built and then those buildings were built higher and higher. Some of the greatest minds in the world were conducting studies in these state of the art labs held in the city. They were researching some of the hardest medical problems to this day and age.
	The town was running great and everything was going just fine. The city flourished for over 60 years. After many long years of trial and error testing with many different types of medicine, the labs had a breakthrough. Using Genetically modified Paragordius varius it was thought that they could start curing many terminal illnesses that never before had been cured. Soon they got the Government's permission to put out a notice to the city they were located in asking any resident with a incurable terminal illness to try the new treatment. They accepted 50 people at first to try the treatment. Remarkably, the treatment worked for all 50 of those people! They were showing signs of improvement within weeks and it seemed the medicine was working miracles. The facility was gaining confidence in their discovery and in the hope of all the lives they could save in the process. The patients continued to improve for weeks and they starting getting there life back. But then, the treatment had a reverse effect. The patients started showing signs of their illness once again and it seemed like the medicine was turning on them. They become more ill than before within just a matter of days and there skin turned a ghost white.
	Then one night, it seemed as if something was triggered in all of the patient's brains. They became very aggravated and starting breaking free of their medical restrictions, something the lab was not prepared for. Soon the mutants overran the entire facility and spread their new adapted infection to the other scientist. Since the infection was already fully developed, on contact between contaminated blood or saliva it instantly took effect on the new host. Within a matter of 15 minutes the new host would be transformed into the mutants that infected it. The city’s main water supply was also exposed to the parasites, thus rapidly increasing the infection rate.
	That night was truly the longest night for Barrowsville. The infection spread like wildfire and the city went into a state of panic. The military was there within the hour the outbreak started and had no choice but to close all routes of exit to contain the spread of the infection. They surrounded the entire city and with armed forces kept everyone inside. Within the next few hours, they were able to put up a metal chain fence that completely surrounded the city. They had to keep the infection and everyone in the city contained to keep the rest of the nation safe. Everyone in Barrowsville was trapped with what was now being called Hydra.
	The night was full of chaos, murder, and contamination was spreading everywhere. When the sun arose, all of the infected quickly fled to darkness as intense light like sunlight burned through their pale skin. The government issued the city crates of equipment to keep themselves safe but unfortunately that’s all they could do. They had no idea what this disease was and how it spread. They knew nothing about it since every scientist was killed that night of the outbreak. For all they knew everyone was infected but the disease was just laying dormant. All they could do was provide assistance to the city and wish them luck. It was up to the people of Barrowsville to fight for themselves.
	The government spent the next few months reinforcing the walls surrounding the city with concrete while guard forces remained active with the order to shoot to kill if anyone was to come close. 
	30 months passed and not much progress was made. The government was able to come with an extremely expensive medicine that when injected into the victim before the infection could take full effect over the host, it would reverse the process and kill the infection. This progress was made a couple months after the outbreak but since then, nothing was able to be accomplished. Once the infection fully took over the host, all hope was lost and the medicine would have no effect. The medicine quickly runs it’s course through the body to clean out the infection and then become useless. It was only effective within the timeframe of one becoming infected and one mutating. It worked the same way as someone using an epipen in today’s age releasing Epinephrine to counter the infection.
	The concrete walls were finished within a matter of months after the outbreak to contain everyone in the city. Military personnel left guard of the walls surrounding the city months after the walls were built for unknown reasons. Everyone still alive in Barrowsville was still completely trapped with little hope of what was to come. No one within the walls had any equipment or the ability to contact anyone outside the walls, so to them they were the last people alive in the world.
	The city completely lost power after the outbreak. The emergency backup generators were automatically initiated around the city. Even two and a half years later they are still illuminating emergency lights; the only sources of artificial light the city has. The generators are unground leaving no opportunity for those alive to access them and use their power.
