# Game Modes

## Match Making:

Online Game Finding - When players want to play online with random players around the world.
	
### Mechanics:	

Connections: Games will be hosted by players so we don't have any dedicated servers to hold and maintain. This will be done in the fashion of how many games handle it like Halo, COD, and others. 

Finding a Match: Find a random match to play in the selected game field the player selected (Deathmatch, Survival, etc.) Once game is found, player will automatically be joined to the game. How it works:

Player can create “party” is multiplayer “waiting room” before searching for a game. When game mode is selected and searching, the host of the “waiting room” will be searching for available players based on location that are searching for the same game mode. Once the game get to the point where I match can be created, it will be created and the host for that match will be selected based on best internet connection. If the host were to ever leave, host migration will occur. This will get the list of all the players in the game and choose the one with the best connection, then appoint them as the host. Once the game ends, players will be set back to the waiting lobby with their respected parties.

Games can only be searched if the player’s party size is below a maximum set number. Example, we don’t want 7 players in a party going in searching game modes that have a max of 8. This could lead to boosting, targeting a single player, etc. This is what custom games are for.

Custom Games - When players want to just play game modes with friends or even just by themselves.


### Mechanics:
		
Connections: Games will have designated host that will be able to completely set up the game and game settings. Can set up a lobby with a party system as explained above. If the host were to leave then host migration with take action as usual to try and appoint a new host. 

Available Game Modes:

Survival - Player(s) are loaded in a certain part of the city and have to survive through scavenging, crafting, & raiding. Last player alive in the server will be declared the winner. Game mode can be searched through 3 different settings (short game, medium game, long game).

### Mechanics:

Players are first loaded into a game lobby with all the connected players. Players will then have the opportunity to pick which part of the city they’d like to survive in. The map that will be played will be based on majority decision. If there is a tie, than one of the two will be randomly chosen.

The players will all then be loaded into the correct map and spawned randomly through the map. Players are able to scavenge, craft, and kill other players when desired. Game is heavily dependant on day and night cycle which is decided by game settings (short, medium, long). This will set up food and thirst depletion times as well as mutants being active only during the night setting.

The last player alive in the server wins the match. Once a player dies, he will get experience points for his actions and will be returned to the lobby. 

Player WILL have an inventory system, crafting and scavenging ability, survival and life vitals. Player will also have a small loadout to spawn into the game with.

Deathmatch - Player versus player action packed gameplay similar to Call of Duty. 

### Mechanics:

Players are first loaded into a game lobby with all the connected players. Players will then have the opportunity to pick which part of the city they’d like to battle in. The map that will be played will be based on majority decision. If there is a tie, than one of the two will be randomly chosen.

The players will all then be loaded into the correct map and spawned accordingly (either with team if team deathmatch or randomly if free for all). Day and night cycle is frozen (unless we want a map to still be on this rotation). First team/player to reach desired score or the team/player with the highest score at the end of the allowed time wins.

Player will NOT have an inventory system, crafting and scavenging ability, survival and life vitals besides health. Player will spawn with a custom made class of weapons and attributes made from the menu. There will be weapons around the map to pick up as power weapons as well as other player’s weapons they’ve have dropped. Player will have up to 4 custom classes for loadouts.

Mutants Versus Humans - Player versus player action packed gameplay where one team plays as humans and one team plays as mutants.

### Mechanics:

Players are first loaded into a game lobby with all the connected players. Players will then have the opportunity to pick which part of the city they’d like to battle in. The map that will be played will be based on majority decision. If there is a tie, than one of the two will be randomly chosen.

The players will all then be loaded into the correct map and spawned accordingly (either with team if team deathmatch or randomly if free for all).

Player will spawn with a custom made class of weapons and attributes made from the menu. If the player is mutant, then player will spawn as custom made mutant with certain attributes and perks. There will be weapons around the map to pick up as power weapons as well as other player’s weapons they’ve have dropped. Player will have up to 4 custom classes for loadouts.

Horde Missions - Player(s) take on objective based missions to achieve a certain task. Always will occur at night or approaching night. Replaces single player game mode and can tell a story through the missions of what has happened to the city.

### Mechanics:

Players are first loaded into a game lobby with all the connected players. Players will then have the opportunity to pick which mission they would like to play. The mission that will be played will be based on majority decision. If there is a tie, than one of the two will be randomly chosen.

The players will all then be loaded into the correct map and spawned accordingly. Day and night cycle is extremely slow or frozen in the night time setting. Player(s) have to battle mutants and achieve tasks to complete the mission.

Player WILL have an inventory system, crafting and scavenging ability, survival and life vitals. If player dies, they will respawn in an amount of time and drop all their belongs where they died. Death count of a player stacks for the next respawn time to discourage players from dying. Also, the player’s belongings dropped will disappear if not picked up in time. If every player dies, the mission has been failed. Player will have a custom class for each character. Player is allowed to make up to 4 characters, each with their own level and custom class. New character begin back at level 1.

Rank Matches - Same thing as playing a regular game but now a rank is attached to your account for that game mode. Be matched against those who are only at your same rank or very close to it.
